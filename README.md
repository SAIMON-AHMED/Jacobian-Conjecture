# Jacobian-Based Public-Key Cryptosystem

This repository accompanies the research paper:  
“A Polynomial Public-Key Cryptosystem Based on Jacobian-Preserving Composition.”

## Features
- Generate triangular and affine maps with Jacobian determinant = 1
- Symbolically verify invertibility and algebraic security
- GUI for generating and inspecting maps
- Fully reproducible with test suite and examples

## Contents
- `/src`: SageMath scripts to generate and verify maps
- `/tests`: Determinant and inversion tests
- `/app`: Streamlit GUI app
- `/paper`: LaTeX version of the full research paper

## Getting Started
1. Install [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)
2. Run a map generator:
